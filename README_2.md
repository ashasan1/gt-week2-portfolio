# Week 2- Portfolio Webpage

This project is a portfolio webpage for Asha Sanford.

I created a "work" section on the page that has placeholder spots to showcase future projects.

I created a navagation bar under the site header to help visitors navigate through the page and quickly find the correct place.

I created a "contact me" section for visitors to reach out to Asha Sanford through phone, email, etc for additional information.
